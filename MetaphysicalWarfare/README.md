#Metaphysical Warfare

This is a small web game made in Javascript and HTML5. The theme for this game is "abstraction."

##Compilation/Execution

I tested and ran this game using a WAMP server. The folder was placed in the "www" subdirectory of the "wamp" folder. If you do not have a server of your own, this is a simple way to get this game running. Afterward, just type the path to the HTML file located in this folder (it is named after the game).
